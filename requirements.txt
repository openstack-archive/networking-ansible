# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.

ansible-runner>=1.0.5 # Apache-2.0
neutron-lib>=1.13.0,<1.17.0 # Apache-2.0
pbr>=2.0.0,!=2.1.0 # Apache-2.0
# NOTE(jlibosva): We don't use pexpect per-se. But we pass parameter down to
# ansible-runner that is then passed along to pexpect. And this parameter is
# implemented in pexpect 2.5 as earliest. In order to avoid constraints job
# failure we don't require pexpect here as Queens upper-constraints pexpect
# is lower than 2.5. As a workaround we install pexpect with devstack.
# TODO(jlibosva): Investigate if we should have a minimal requirement in
# ansible-runner itself.
